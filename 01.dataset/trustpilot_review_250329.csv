2,Catarina Ferreira,PT,4,"Mar 9, 2025","March 07, 2025",First and last purchase with them,"This was my first time working with DeliveredKorea and will probably be my last. Firstly everything went smooth I was buying the products, any questions I had they were really quickly to reply and after I asked for consolidation and shipment and it was done very fast. The problem happened when the package got stuck and customs. This is an almost 700€ package and there was missing paperwork which I asked DeliveredKorea for and for the first time they actually took quite a while to reply and did not provide the paperwork I asked for. I am being asked proof of payment but the payment platform they use does not provide a receipt after you paid which is the document I need. Long story short, the package will be returned to them, I will not be able to ship it again since I would have to pay for shipping again and it would once again get stuck in customs and I do not have enough documentation because DeliveredKorea does not provide. So basically DeliveredKorea will  get to keep all my items and money and I will lose 700€. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL BE CAREFUL",1

6,Tay,ES,4,"Feb 4, 2025","February 03, 2025",No concern over loyal customers,"I have been using Delivered Korea's service for three years without an issue so I was surprised when they recently decided not to warn Spanish customers that the option to ship via K-packet was no longer available and also decided not to honor packages that had been requested to ship before the cutout date (that they didn't announce) with even a discount or coupon code. This meant my package containing two flat items that could easily be shipped as a standard letter ended up only with shipping options that started at $25. A ""sorry we didn't give you the positive response you were expecting"" e-mail is all I received in exchange of years of being a loyal customer. Quite disappointing, to say the least.",2

Easy to use, if there is anything unclear, the support staff responds quickly, prices are better than of competition and free storage longer.The only minus I have found so far is the proxy service that needs to be submitted for each item separately instead of one order from one shop, thus some value-based benefits might be missed, however the price of all combined is still lower than of other proxies.Can only recommend.",5

The seller also refused to take a return, although they did not describe the condition of the product in the post. I was quite upset and was ready to take a loss. However, Delivered Korea still was able to cancel the order for this reason and agreed to process a refund. I really appreciate their service and would recommend them to anybody.",5

57,mar,MX,1,"Oct 8, 2024","May 18, 2024",Easy Korean warehouse,"I've been using Delivered Korea for 5 months and so far I'm satisfied with their services.Strengths: it's easy to use it, the website is intuitive and there are many tutorials you can follow; the process can be really fast when it comes to inform when packages arrive, consolidation and shipping; custom service is good, sometimes it can take a while (especially after weekends and holidays) but they always answer to emails; shipping cost is competitive and I would say even lower than other warehouses.Weaknesses: you cannot know the product's condition or if the package has actually arrived unless you pay for a photo; ""We buy"" orders sometimes are slow, also you can't buy more than 1  product (you can choose the quantity for that product only) even if it's from the same store; free storage period is shorter than other warehouses.However, I only recommended it when you buy a lot of products. There is a $3 fee for each package, even for poly bags (which I find too much for bag), so I think it can be quite expensive sometimes.",4

60,cloudy Boy,US,1,"Oct 2, 2024","October 02, 2024",Good,"A streamlined method to buying products off of Korean sites like Bunjang. The process is not too complicated. I choose extra bubble wrap padding for the delivery, so whenever I get my packages, they have been packed well and securely. Two things I would say is that I wish when using their 'we buy orders' method, there's a way to get a little more involved in the process of communicating with a seller, and also to input a custom price for a listing we want when we're only interested in purchasing one item in the picture (instead of going through the refund process). The fee is also on the pricy side, so when you buy multiple items, it can really add up.",4

66,Jessica Jessica,US,1,"Updated Sep 30, 2024","September 28, 2024",A must have service for Korean shopping because it saves money!,"I have used Delivered Korea for a while now, and I am very satisfied with the service I've received. I've shipped 11 big packages to myself with their help.I've used the Bunjang service, We Buy & Ship, and of course, the forwarding service. Never had any problems. It costs $3 each for incoming packages, and I think that is a fair price. I used to use an overpriced proxy buyer but switching to DK has saved me so much money just by allowing me to use their address.Also, the way they package your items when you choose to consolidate is top notch. Very secure - they make sure to use the smallest box that will safely fit all the items, so the shipping cost is as low as it can be. I always use FedEx!My only criticisms are that the We Buy & Shop service needs to go back to being able to buy more than 1 item at a time. It makes it more expensive than it needs to be. Also the Bunjang service is $5 per item. That's really expensive.But besides those two things, it's an excellent service and I recommend it to everyone. Don't shop without a Korean address!",5

80,Miracles Follow me,US,28,"Jul 26, 2024","July 26, 2024",Overall a pretty good experience,"I have used this service to purchase. I enjoy using their platform to make unique purchases from all over Korea. The order is sent to the warehouse where it is stored for free and then afterwards you are charged. In addition they offer a wide variety of shipping services/couriers, and they have additional packaging services (there is a fee for each service).The reason why I am giving 4 out of 5 is because:-consolidating and shipping process takes longer than expected-customer service take a little bit longer to respond to inquiries-Customs fees: there is an import dollar limit, once a buyer goes over than limit a custom fee/tax is imposed. While i do understand that they cannot control that customs charge a fee, a buyer should be informed of the possibility that customs will impose a fee/tax.

81,Jh,US,1,"Updated Jul 25, 2024","July 22, 2024",BE CAREFUL especially when you don't have your tracking number,"I sent my purchase to the Delivered Korea warehouse.I sent an email to the customer service because the form did not come up after two weeks from the expected arrival date, even though I filled out the address, name, and their phone number without any mistakes.They replied a few days later and told me they couldn't do anything without a tracking number to address it. EVEN THOUGH I DON'T NEED TRACKING NUMBER TO USE THEIR SERVICES.Since I made the purchase offline, I did not have a tracking number, so I asked them to look for the missing package in the warehouse, but they still said they could not do anything without a tracking number.I reached the store where I purchased and they gave me the traxking number after all, and when i look for the package online, it was certainly arrived at the warehouse 2 weeks ago.I sent Delivered Korea the tracking number and they told me that my package was their another warehouse called xxxxxx.The ID for that warehouse was blatantly different from mine and there was no way I could be wrong.I was very disappointed because the product I bought this time was the same kind of product that had been doing Give away on their IG. So that made me think that they could have taken things from me.I don't want to have this kind of uneasy feeling again, so I will stop using Derivard Korea after this time.P.S. Okay it was not an ""ID"" but suite number. And your website mentioned I do not need to worry about a tracking number.Cited:""If you do not know the domestic tracking number of your incoming package yet, you don’t need to worry about it since we are going to create the ‘Incoming Order Form’ on your behalf after your package arrives at our warehouse.

I have used their service for almost a year now and there has been great times and sometimes not so great times.Starting with pros, DK has fast forwarding/consolidation time which i love since i also get my package 2-3 days later after paying shipping. Their site is easy to navigate and shows where everything is. At first the customer service was what you expect good customer service to be, but there were times (multiple at that) when questions get ignored (where i would have to contact them on separate occasions because they weren’t being forward with me) and the time for a response back would take 2-3 if not 5 days and by then the item in question that i wanted help with would go out of stock. One thing i am dissatisfied/disappointed by is the fees and exchange rates for the we buy service. Consolidation being $3 becomes very expensive fast. The exchange rate for the we buy service adds almost $4-6 more on top of the price in won. The free warehouse storage date went from 30 days to 45 which is an improvement for sure ! But i know of other proxies that give a full year of free warehouse storage date so … anyways, those are my top cons but other than that the rest of the service was good !",4

After purchasing the product from Bunjang, I thought the shipping fee was included in the price of the product because there was no mention of the shipping fee, but now that I've been asking around on the site, it seems that the shipping fee is set separately and charged to the buyer. In fact, from the buyer's point of view, it may be very difficult to know how much the shipping fee will be charged, and people like me who are purchasing items from this site for the first time do not have information about the shipping fee, so they mistakenly think that the shipping fee is included when purchasing the product like me. I'm not so happy about it because I don't know the amount of the shipping fee yet. I don't know if I can cancel the order depending on the shipping cost later.

142,KJ,GB,3,"Updated Jun 18, 2024","May 13, 2024","Used to be great, but now not so much","I’ve used Delivered Korea a few times now and they’re pretty reliable as long as everything is straightforward. The items are always packed with care and the shipping fees are competitive (If you need extra services though, the additional fees can soon add up). If I was basing my review on this alone it would definitely be 5 stars.However, If you have a query or something goes wrong they can be extremely slow to respond. It can sometimes take them 4 - 5 days to reply to a email and they don’t have a discord server or online help, which would speed the process up.  There’s a phone number but calls to SK can be expensive. They are also slow to order on Bunjang too if that’s what you plan on using them for.Edit: I have never felt the need to edit and downgrade a review before but the service DK are providing is getting worse and worse. I’ve been using them for 2 years with no problems but my latest experience has been really bad. It is taking more than a week to answer emails, their services such as consolidation and inclusion only are extremely slow. I paid for shipping almost a week ago and my package has been on hold since with no explanation. I used to recommend DK to anyone who would listen but based on my most recent experience I’m afraid that I won’t be doing that anymore.Their explanation is that they are going through a busy period, well then hire more staff. A large portion of their customer base are KPOP GOMs so when is it not going to be busy? I’m also hearing some worrying things on Twitter and Reddit about items missing or items being damaged which is extremely concerning. So much so that I arranged shipping for 3 signed albums separately so that there’s no possibility of anything happening to them at the warehouse during the consolidation stage.I’m wondering if they are actually a victim of their own success and can’t keep up with demand. I’m sorry to say this but if their service doesn’t improve I’ll have to use another company, which is such a shame because I used to love using them.And they really need to add a chat function to their website or at least provide better signposting if they require further information.

Their website is fairly well laid out, but you have to know where to look. There are some free services that are kind of hidden (like requesting photos of your item). Similarly, there's a lot of behind the scenes communications they do with sellers that they won't share (unless you ask, I presume). It'd be nice if you were able to cap the max you'd like to spend on a transaction, as I got a nice surprise price jump of about $18 on a Bunjang item since they didn't keep me up to date on the negotiations. But most of the time, all their fees are stated clearly — there's just quiiite a lot of them, so purchases add up fast. But as long as you're prepared to empty out your wallet, you should have a very easy time purchasing whatever you'd like. Oh, and be prepared to wait to hear back for pricing on items *not* on Bunjang, especially if it's over the weekend. I put in some requests on a Thursday and think I finally got updates late on Tuesday.",3

Only areas that could use improving would be the response times (somtimes 2-3 days in response time is too long, i.e. in case of events etc.), the other area is that the connection between the ""We Buy"" / ""You Buy""-sections and the ""My Packages"" section is very hard to understand. You basically have to use multiple windows and compare multiple-digit numbers. IMHO its important to get a full overview of what exactly is in your packages.

I also shopped on their DK Shop for some albums that were on sale and an item that was out of stock elsewhere. The prices are very fair. (It took a few days to ship to out due to the holiday).

I had vaguely heard something about doing this, but it was the cost of Weverse sending them on that made me look into it more closely and I relied a lot on the good reviews on this site.Setting it up is fairly straightforward. There are videos and instructions on site, but allow yourself time to read them and check what’s involved. You will need to have a Korean keyboard enabled, so I used my iPad for typing the address and had the website open in front of me my computer to copy type. Double check what you type, sometimes I didn’t leave a space, so it took a character into the wrong syllable and changed the word.They are very good at keeping in touch. Once my goods arrived I had to log back in to choose my courier and make payment. It was either they or Weverse who packed the box well with plenty of bubble wrap.The courier cost was quite reasonable- my only experience with couriers is sending documents. This heavy box with four DVD box sets cost about £62 only £5 less than a single page document I sent recently.I would certainly use them again.",5

199,Nina Soerensen,DK,26,"Nov 17, 2023","November 17, 2023","Abysmal Service, Irresponsible Attitude - Avoid Delivered Korea at All Costs!","I recently had the displeasure of dealing with Delivered Korea, and my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. I entrusted them with the delivery of a package valued at over $300, and their incompetence and dismissive attitude have left me utterly infuriated.Firstly, let's talk about their alleged delivery partner, FedEx. According to Delivered Korea, my package was delivered by FedEx, but what they conveniently omit is the fact that the delivery was nothing short of a reckless abandonment. Despite the significant value of the package, FedEx left it at my door unattended, without any form of approval from me. This blatant disregard for security and customer satisfaction is unacceptable.Upon contacting Delivered Korea to address this issue, I was met with a dismissive and unhelpful response. Instead of taking responsibility for the lapse in their delivery process, they chose to deflect blame onto FedEx, as if washing their hands of the matter somehow absolves them of their duty to ensure a safe and secure delivery.What's even more infuriating is their refusal to acknowledge the lack of proper authorization for leaving the package unattended. I never approved such a delivery method, and the fact that they are trying to shift blame rather than address the core issue is indicative of their lack of commitment to customer satisfaction.It's apparent that Delivered Korea is more interested in absolving themselves of responsibility than ensuring the safe and secure delivery of valuable packages. Their customer service is a joke, and their dismissive attitude towards legitimate concerns is appalling. I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy, and I strongly advise anyone considering their services to steer clear.In conclusion, Delivered Korea has proven to be a company that prioritizes passing the buck over providing reliable and secure delivery services. Save yourself the frustration and potential loss by choosing a more responsible and customer-centric courier service. Delivered Korea has lost my trust, and I can only hope that potential customers heed this warning and avoid the headache that comes with entrusting them with their valuable shipments.",1

Considering how shipping overseas can be expensive, some items you buy only use large boxes so I would be grateful if they offered those services together. Also, I would be obliged to use their proxy service more often (like Bunjang) if they charge in their Korean Won currency instead of USD. The usage of USD is the only thing that's holding me back from using more of their services altogether. I wish the entirety of their site charged in Korean Won currency.",4

The shipping costs are transparent on the website and the website itself is very easy to use.Just a heads up if you want to cancel a repack request you totally can! (Even though they said no on the website). Just shoot them an email BEFORE the status change and they will literally sort it out for you ASAP.Thanks a lot DK!,5

First of all, I would like to thank Delivered Korea for hosting a giveaway in which I am one of the winners. I'm so happy to have this album, and I will forever treasure this. The parcel was secure with thick plastic bubbles, and the album was in good condition. Though, I received the package just now when it supposedly would arrive last Friday (May 26, 2023). The delivery man was not able to deliver the package due to vehicle problems, which is understandable.Thank you so much, Delivered Korea! God bless you and more customers to come. Bye-bye~",5

Communication has always been fantastic especially as I had a few questions to ask about a product I wanted to purchase. I've used a few other proxy services before trying Delivered Korea and won't be using any more as I've found the perfect one for me. I highly recommend.,5

217,Volky,NL,1,"Updated Jan 19, 2023","January 18, 2023",Terrible bot-like communication,"Terrible bot-like communication. Made one order from the same Korean company, calculated and paid shipping cost, they ship me one item and kept the other in the warehouse. Paid $35 for one box of cookies, it is a joke. BEWARE: expect nothing communication-wise as a first-time customer.UPDATE: Their way of solving the issue is:“Thank you for reaching out to Delivered support team. We’ve added $1 on your account of DK points. Please proceed checkout of your package.”Basically I have a remaining balance left of $35 and my next shipping cost would be $36. So they’re making me pay for the shipment. Luckily we have PayPal, so I reported this and PayPal is further handling the refund case.UPDATE 2: They’re now making excuses that I should have mentioned that they should be shipped together. I made 1 order with 2 items, not 2 seperate orders. Note that I contacted them on Facebook messenger that I want to ship them together (wish I could provide screenshots here) and this was BEFORE they were shipped. Their customer support agent did not contact me through email either.These people do not represent the good quality service of Koreans! My complaint still stands.",1

If you can purchase and use their (free) Korean address they give you a lot of shipping options to get the package overseas, they consolidate and ship items quicker than other services I’ve used and their customer service responds quickly and in detail. Highly recommend! So far I’ve found quicker ways to purchase the items myself but their buyer service seems very simple too",5

223,Abi S,GB,2,"Nov 22, 2022","November 22, 2022",Amazing company :),I was sceptical ordering from this company as I’ve never heard of it before. However I couldn’t be far more wrong! My sister likes Korean pop music so i decided to make an order with the company. I placed the order on the 6th october using we buy we ship. Super easy to use and with a small fee. I did receive my parcel on 17th November using Koreanpost which was the cheapest option for me. However I’m still stoked at how quick I received the parcel. I couldn’t be happier and will be using this service again :),5

I was impressed when I ordered from Delivered Korea because I had to use some extra services (changing my box because it came huge and I couldn’t use K-packet initially) and since I never used their site before I was expecting it would be harder to deal with needing a personalized service but I was wrong, they were very polite and helped me all the way so I felt very confident by their seriousness at their work. Their support team is so helpful that this fact by itself would be a good experience, but I also had a smooth and easy delivery to my country. Even though I asked them to change the original box all my items came intact and with proper care. If you’re questioning if their service is worth I would say “go for it” because they have a great support team and this is a trustworthy company even if you’re a beginner buying from overseas like I am.",5

The DELIVERED team was able to get it each and every time. It's also clear that they listen to customer feedback -- the site just keeps getting better and better. I do wish that they didn't charge for photos and that they'd add more packing materials in their boxes. However, I'm overall very satisfied with my experience. They've gotten themselves a lifelong customer :)(Also -- I can't get over how cute their mascot is. A box dog!)*Note: the shipping costs ARE high but that is out of their control. If you are from the USA in particular, international shipping will be AT LEAST $10 (most likely more) for a light item. The pandemic has led to significant delays and an increase in shipping charges all across the board. I knew this going in and it does not affect my rating. DELIVERED has a shipping calculator on their site as well and it's been pretty accurate for me so far.",5
